# Online-Sudoku-game-using-web-development
Created a Sudoku game using Html, CSS, and JS from scratch. Contains multiple elements like error detection, Lives and Timer. The user is provided to fill in all the missing numbers in the given time that can be selected by the user. The user can also select the level of difficulty and the time he need to complete the game.
